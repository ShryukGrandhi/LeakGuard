## 💬 Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q: "Is this really automated or just a demo?"
**A:** "The AI logic is real—edge agents detect anomalies using threshold algorithms and trend analysis. The blockchain contracts are fully functional Solidity code. In production, this would connect to actual well sensors and real crew dispatch systems. What you're seeing is the complete automated workflow."

### Q: "How do you prevent false positives?"
**A:** "Three layers: First, the edge agent requires 3 consecutive readings above 2.0 PPM—not just one spike. Second, the Master Agent validates using historical trends and integrity scores. Third, the contract approval step adds human oversight before committing funds."

### Q: "What if the crew rejects the job?"
**A:** "The system automatically searches for the next available crew. It can expand the search radius and adjust the bounty amount to ensure coverage. The escrow remains locked until someone accepts."

### Q: "How much does this save Pytheas?"
**A:** "Per incident: $5,000 crew cost, but we earn $2,500 in ESG credits and save $25,000 in insurance premiums and regulatory fines. Net benefit: $22,500 per prevented leak. With 50+ wells, the ROI is massive."

## ⚡ Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

### 1. Build Anticipation
When the contract modal appears, pause and say:
> "Watch this—the AI is drafting a legal smart contract right now, analyzing all the parameters..."

Then let them watch the progress bar fill up. The suspense builds impact.

### 2. Read the Numbers
When the contract details appear, read them out:
> "$5,000 bounty, 45-minute response time, drone inspection included..."

This makes it feel more real.

### 3. Show Emotion
When the crew accepts:
> "Perfect! Mike and Sarah have accepted. They're 18 minutes away."

Your enthusiasm is contagious.

### 4. Emphasize Speed
> "Notice this entire workflow—from detection to crew dispatch—took 30 seconds. In traditional systems, this would take hours of phone calls and manual coordination."
