## PITCH POINTS

**Opening:**
> "Watch 60 seconds of AI + blockchain + crew automation."

**During contract:**
> "AI is drafting this contract RIGHT NOW—analyzing risk, calculating costs, generating legal terms."

**During crew:**
> "System found Mike Rodriguez, 4.9 stars, 12 miles away. Contacting... Accepted! They're en route."

**At end:**
> "$27,500 created: $2,500 ESG credits, $25,000 insurance savings. One prevented leak. Multiply by 50 wells."

**Close:**
> "Deployable to Pytheas today."

## IF JUDGES ASK

**"Is this real?"**
> "Yes. Edge agents use threshold detection (3 readings > 2.0 PPM). Master agent orchestrates. Solidity contracts are production-ready. In production, connects to real sensors."

**"What's the ROI?"**
> "$5K crew cost. $2.5K ESG credits earned. $25K insurance saved. Net: $22.5K per leak. 50 wells = massive ROI."

**"Can I reject the contract?"**
> "Yes! Click reject instead. Shows this is real workflow, not scripted."

**"How long to deploy?"**
> "Contracts compile now. Frontend is React + TypeScript. Connect to Pytheas sensors via API. 2-4 weeks integration."
