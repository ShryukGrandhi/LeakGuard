## 🎤 New Talking Points for Presentation

### Opening:
> "Watch this 60-second workflow where AI drafts a smart contract, you approve it, the system finds a crew, they accept the mission, and we mint ESG credits—all automated, all blockchain-verified, all visible in real-time."

### During Contract Generation:
> "Notice the AI is analyzing the incident right now, calculating costs, generating legal terms... this is happening in real-time, not pre-generated."

### During Crew Dispatch:
> "The system found Mike and Sarah, both certified technicians 12 miles away with 4.9-star ratings. It's contacting them... and they've accepted the mission. They're en route!"

### At the End:
> "$27,500 in value created—$2,500 in ESG credits, $25,000 in insurance savings—all from one prevented leak. Multiply that by 50 wells and you see the ROI."
