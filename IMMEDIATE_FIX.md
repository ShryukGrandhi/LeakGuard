## 🔴 CRITICAL: Open Browser Console

1. Go to http://localhost:3002
2. Press **F12**
3. Click **Console** tab
4. **Screenshot what you see and send it to me**

I need to see the errors!

---

## 🔍 Things to Look For:

1. Any **RED error messages**?
2. Does it say "Map loaded successfully!"?
3. Does it say "Mapbox token set successfully"?
4. Any network errors (403, 401, etc)?

---

## 📊 What I Think Is Wrong:

Mapbox-gl IS installed, but either:
- Map container isn't rendering
- Mapbox API is rejecting the token
- CSS is hiding the map
- React error is crashing the component

**I NEED TO SEE THE CONSOLE TO FIX IT!**

**SEND ME THE CONSOLE ERRORS!** 🔴
